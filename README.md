Epic Style Guides
===================

Every major open-source project has its own style guide: a set of conventions
(sometimes arbitrary) about how to write code for that project. It is much
easier to understand a large codebase when all the code in it is in a
consistent style.

“Style” covers a lot of ground, from “use camelCase for variable names” to
“never use global variables” to “never use exceptions.” This project
([epic1979/styleguide](https://github.com/epic1979/styleguide)) links to the
style guidelines we use for Epic code. If you are modifying a project that
originated at Epic, you may be pointed to this page to see the style guides
that apply to that project.
